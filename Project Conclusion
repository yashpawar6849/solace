assess, and support the mental health and well-being of children. Such solutions provide a comprehensive

allowing for timely intervention. By providing a comprehensive view of mental health, these solutions can help
improve the quality of life of children and allow for more effective and timely interventions. Furthermore, these
solutions can help to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health and provide a safe environment for children
to get the help they need.
