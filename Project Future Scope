The scope of the Mental Health and Well-Being Surveillance, Assessment, and Tracking Solution (MHWSTS)
covers the development of an integrated solution that combines evidence-based mental health interventions,
comprehensive data collection and tracking, and real-time monitoring and evaluation. The solution will
leverage existing resources, such asnational and international data sources, and utilize advanced analytics to
identify risk factors and create tailored interventions for children. It will also provide an online platform for
mental health practitioners and parents to access resources, provide feedback, and track progress. Finally, the
solution will use machine learning and artificial intelligence to automate certain partsof the process, such as the
collection and processing of data. The scope of the project also includes the development of an evaluation plan
to assess the effectiveness of the solution, as well as the definition of policy and regulatory frameworks to
ensure the safe and ethical use of the solution. The MHWSTS solution will be developed in three phases. The
first phase will focus on data collection and analysis, including the development of a comprehensive data
repository and the implementation of advanced analytics. The second phase will focus on the implementation
of the online platform, including the development of user interfaces and the integration of data sources. The
third phase will focus on the implementation of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms.
