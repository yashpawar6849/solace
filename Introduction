The Mental Health and Well-Being Surveillance, Assessment, and Tracking Solution (MHWSTS) is a
comprehensive solution that seeks to address the growing need for mental health and well-being among
children. The solution combines evidence-based mental health interventions, comprehensive data collection
and tracking, and real-time monitoring and evaluation. The goal of MHWSTS is to provide an integrated,
comprehensive solution that can be used to identify, assess, and address mental health issues among children.
MHWSTS will leverage existing resources, such as national and international data sources, and utilize
advanced analytics to identify risk factors and create tailored interventions for children.It will also provide an
online platform for mental health practitioners and parents to access resources, provide feedback, and track
progress. Finally, the solution will use machine learning and artificial intelligence to automate certain parts of
the process, such as the collection and processing of data. This will create a single, easily accessible source of
information that can be used to both identify and address mental health issues among children. The MHWSTS
solution will be developed in three phases. The first phase will focus on data collection and analysis, including
the development of a comprehensive data repository and the implementation of advanced analytics. Its second
phase will hugely be focused on the implementation, including the development of user interfaces and the
integration of data sources. The third phase will concentrate on the implementation of AI & ML algorithms. The
MHWSTS solution will be developed in collaboration with stakeholders from various sectors, including mental
health practitioners, parents, public health professionals, and policy makers. The stakeholders will provide
feedback throughout the development process to ensure that the solution meets the needs of the target
population.
